You are a manager of a Rollercoaster in a Theme Park.
Unfortunatly, since the ride is "quite sick", not everyone is allowed to enter.

Rules:
- Kids below the age of 14 must be accompanied by an adult
- Minimum Height is 1m10
- Extra Care:
    - People in wheelchairs are only allowed when accompanied by someone who can help them get on and off the ride.
    - Pregant women are not allowed on the ride
    - People with heart conditions are not allowed on the ride

Write a class and unit tests that validate the entry of different customers based on the rules above.
If a Customer is not allowed to enter, throw an exception.
You are free to choose if you throw 1 exception with different message, or multiple exceptions.
It must be clear why that person is not allowed on the ride.
